# Crossmint Challenge

This repo was created for the Crossmint coding challenge, currently including Phase 1. Phase 2 is
still being implemented.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies.

I have included a `requirements.txt` file that you can use to install the required packages, like so:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Invoke the main script to automatically perform the necessary requests to the challenge API.

```bash
python main.py
```
